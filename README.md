This is <b>ChEATER</b> - Chess Engine for Augmented Training and Enhanced Reasoning. A little project of mine to help those who want to learn how to play chess through winning.

In its core this is a highly modular program for recognizing positions and parsing them in to FEN strings. It uses stockfish 9 and you are able to adjust the power of the engine.
